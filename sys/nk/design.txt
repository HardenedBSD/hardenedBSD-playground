<=== Modules ===>
  - vMMU: vmmu.[c,h]
    - init, declare, update, and remove PTPs
  - CPU Functions: nk_cpufunc.h
    - Updates of: cr0, cr3, cr4, and MSRs
  - Secure Wrapper: nk_gates.[c,h]

<=== Design ===>
  - Need externally visible function and internally non-visible functions. 
  - All externally visible functions will be declared in nk_* header files. 
  - All internally visible files will be in non-nk header files. 

<=== To Do ===>
  - [ ] Compiler and Linker and Loader;;
    - [x] Modify to include extra section for protected space data;;
    - [x] Make sure all internal data structures are declared on WPed pages;;
    - [ ] Check to see if "hidden" functions can be called from main source;;
    - [ ] Can we use the #ifdef NESTEDKERNEL for the loader script;;
    - [ ] Add zero squashing to keep kernel small;;
    - [ ] Statically allocate memory for nested kernel operations --- create
          pages solely for this;;
  - [ ] Nested Kernel Interface;;
    - [ ] Move nested code into a hidden library;;
    - [ ] Make the secure stack SMP capable;;
  - [ ] Protected CPU Functionality;;
    - [ ] CR4;;
      - [ ] from persp;;
      - [ ] New ones from Grep;;
    - [ ] CR3;;
      - [ ] CR3s from the perspicuos implementation;;
      - [ ] New ones from Grep;;
      - [ ] Check for registered PTP base page in NK write func;;
    - [ ] MSRs;;
      - [ ] SMEP in MSRs;;
      - [ ] from the perspicuos implementation;;
      - [ ] New ones from Grep;;
      - [ ] Setup code to deal with detecting availability of SMEP;;
  - [ ] vMMU;;
    - [ ] Initialization;;
      - [ ] Initialize DMAP investigate how it works and make sure it is
            correclty working;;
            - [ ] DMAP init all non-code pages as NX;;
            - [ ] DMAP init all code pages as X + WP;;
            - [ ] DMAP init all user pages as U (should be none in init);;
      - [ ] Initial page walk to track page descriptors for kernel base pages;;
      - [ ] Get size of physical memory and allocate space for descriptors
            dynamically;;
      - [x] makePTReadOnly --- fix this to handle 2MB pages;;
    - [ ] declare_*;;
    - [ ] update_*;;
    - [ ] remove_*;;
